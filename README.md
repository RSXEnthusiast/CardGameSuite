# CardGameSuite
The goal of this project is to create a card game suite application that features nontraditional card games for android mobile devices. The application includes an easy-to-use online and AI multiplayer use, card animation movement and a variety of settings to create an individualized experience for each user. This project is ever growing and adapting as new games are added over time.
