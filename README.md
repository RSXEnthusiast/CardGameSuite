# CardGameSuite
The goal of this project is to create a card game suite application that features nontraditional card games for android mobile devices. The application currently includes two games (Fives and Solitaire), an up to 6 player online and AI multiplayer, card animation movement and a variety of settings to create an individualized experience for each user. This project is ever growing and adapting as new games are added over time. Our target users are card game enthusiasts who would like to learn to play something not already on the card application market.
